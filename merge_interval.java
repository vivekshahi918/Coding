///*****MERGE INTERVAL OVERLAPPING******///

////*** APPROACH ***////
// 1. Sort the intervals based on the start time.
// 2. Create a new list to store the merged intervals.
// 3. Iterate through the sorted intervals and compare the current interval with the last merged interval.
// 4. If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval, merge them by updating the end time of the last merged interval.
// 5. If the current interval does not overlap, add it to the list of merged intervals.
