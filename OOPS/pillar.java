// Java is not 100% object orientes programming language because it has some primitive datatype
// like int, char, boolean etc which are not objects but java provides wrapper classes for these primitive datatypes
// like Integer, Charaacter , Boolean etc which are objects and can be used in place of primitive datatypes when needed.
// and java have static keyword which is used to create static members of a class which can be accessed without 
// creating an object of the class.

//Encapsulation -geter and setter
//Abstraction -abstract class and interface
//Inheritance - super and sub class
//Polymorphism -method overloading and method overriding
